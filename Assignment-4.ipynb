Use the shell to change the directory to this path (`cd xx/yy/d2l-en`) and run the command `jupyter notebook`. If your browser does not do this automatically, open http://localhost:8888 and you will see the interface of Jupyter and all the folders containing the code of the book, as shown in :numref:`fig_jupyter00`.\n","\n","![The folders containing the code of this book.](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en-colab/blob/master/img/jupyter00.png?raw=1)\n",":width:`600px`\n",":label:`fig_jupyter00`\n","\n","\n","You can access the notebook files by clicking on the folder displayed on the webpage.\n","They usually have the suffix \".ipynb\".\n","For the sake of brevity, we create a temporary \"test.ipynb\" file.\n","The content displayed after you click it is\n","shown in :numref:`fig_jupyter01`.\n","This notebook includes a markdown cell and a code cell. The content in the markdown cell includes \"This Is a Title\" and \"This is text.\".\n","The code cell contains two lines of Python code.\n","\n","![Markdown and code cells in the \"text.ipynb\" file.](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en-colab/blob/master/img/jupyter01.png?raw=1)\n",":width:`600px`\n",":label:`fig_jupyter01`\n","\n","\n","Double click on the markdown cell to enter edit mode.\n","Add a new text string \"Hello world.\" at the end of the cell, as shown in :numref:`fig_jupyter02`.\n","\n","![Edit the markdown cell.](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en-colab/blob/master/img/jupyter02.png?raw=1)\n",":width:`600px`\n",":label:`fig_jupyter02`\n","\n","\n","As demonstrated in :numref:`fig_jupyter03`,\n","click \"Cell\" $\\rightarrow$ \"Run Cells\" in the menu bar to run the edited cell.\n","\n","![Run the cell.](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en-colab/blob/master/img/jupyter03.png?raw=1)\n",":width:`600px`\n",":label:`fig_jupyter03`\n","\n","After running, the markdown cell is shown in :numref:`fig_jupyter04`.\n","\n","![The markdown cell after running.](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en-colab/blob/master/img/jupyter04.png?raw=1)\n",":width:`600px`\n",":label:`fig_jupyter04`\n","\n","\n","Next, click on the code cell.

If Linux or macOS is installed on your local machine (Windows can also support this function through third-party software such as PuTTY), you can use port forwarding:\n","\n","```\n","ssh myserver -L 8888:localhost:8888\n","```\n","\n","The above string `myserver` is the address of the remote server.\n","Then we can use http://localhost:8888 to access the remote server `myserver` that runs Jupyter notebooks. We will detail on how to run Jupyter notebooks on AWS instances\n","later in this appendix.\n","\n","### Timing\n","\n","We can use the `ExecuteTime` plugin to time the execution of each code cell in Jupyter notebooks.\n","Use the following commands to install the plugin:\n","\n","```\n","pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n","jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n","jupyter nbextension enable execute_time/ExecuteTime\n","```\n","\n","## Summary\n","\n","* Using the Jupyter Notebook tool, we can edit, run, and contribute to each section of the book.\n","* We can run Jupyter notebooks on remote servers using port forwarding.\n","\n","\n","## Exercises\n","\n","1. Edit and run the code in this book with the Jupyter Notebook on your local machine.\n","1. Edit and run the code in this book with the Jupyter Notebook *remotely* via port forwarding.\n","1. Compare the running time of the operations $\\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}$ for two square matrices in $\\mathbb{R}^{1024 \\times 1024}$.
